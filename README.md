# RISC-V
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a RISC-V processor. The project aims to provide a customizable and extensible processor design based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture.
In this project, I implemented the famous 32-bit RISCV Processor. It's a single-cycle microarchitecture RISC-V processor based on Harvard Architecture, which means that it has two separate memories for instruction and data. The single-cycle processor executes an entire instruction in one cycle. In other words, instruction fetch, instruction decode, execute, write back, and program counter update occurs within a single clock cycle.
